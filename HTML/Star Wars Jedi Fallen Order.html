    <p id="Description">If you were looking to follow the main story path only, you're looking at roughly 14-18 hours to reach the end of Cal's journey. I've also unlocked the platinum trophy for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which added an extra 12 hours onto my playtime, for a total of 34 hours to get all the game's trophies.</p>
